# SimpleRPGDiceRoller
Final Project for APSU CSCI 4020 Course - Spring 2022

This app is basic virtual RPG (Role-Playing Game) dice roller. 

When the user clicks on the images of a standard RPG dice set (i.e. d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100), 
the app returns a random number (as if dice are rolled). Options available to select the number of 
dice to roll and to include a modifier (+/-) which will be added to the random number to provide the user 
a total. The app also includes a reset button, app preferences, and dice jail (for when dice are not being
"generous" with the roll generated).
